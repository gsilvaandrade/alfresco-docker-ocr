Docker Volumes
In order to enable persistent storage, several Docker Volumes are configured by default. When using from Linux, some permissions on your local folders need to be set.

Identifying the right UID for every folder can be obtained by starting Docker Compose without the volumes declaration. Following lines should be commented in docker-compose.yml file.

    postgres:
#        volumes:
#            - ./data/postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
#            - ./logs/postgres:/var/log/postgresql

    solr6:
#        volumes:
#            - ./data/solr-data:/opt/alfresco-search-services/data

Once the volumes have been commented, start Docker Compose.

$ docker-compose up --build --force-recreate
After that, you can find the SOLR Docker Image and the UID of the user owning data folders (solr by default).

$ docker ps
ded1748f961f    nginx:stable-alpine   tmp_proxy_1
b01e0abb3c0e    tmp_alfresco          tmp_alfresco_1
4fef719112ad    postgres:10.1         tmp_postgres_1
99a4bd6ede52    tmp_share             tmp_share_1
554236b9bedf    tmp_solr6             tmp_solr6_1

$ docker exec -it tmp_solr6_1 sh

$ cd /opt/alfresco-search-services/

$ ls -la
drwxr-xr-x 5 solr solr 4096 Nov 21 13:07 data

$ id -u solr
33007
Stop Docker Container and set the right permissions on your host folder.

$ docker-compose down

$ sudo chown -R 33007 data/solr-data
You could need to adjust also the permissions for postgres user inside PostgreSQL Docker Image. By default the UID is 999, but you can perform similar operations as above to guess this number.

$ sudo chown -R 999 logs
Uncomment the lines in your docker-compose.yml for the volumes declaration and your Docker Compose should be ready to use.

In case you want to clean your environment (loosing all the data inside), you can remove all this Docker containers to start from scratch.

For instance, for an installation in a folder name tmp, following command will remove all the information persisted.

$ docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q --filter name=tmp_)

Service URLs
These are default URLs, selecting HTTP port 80.

If you selected a different port (for instance 8080), the services will be available in http://localhost:8080.

If you selected https, the services will be available in https://localhost

If you included a different server name from localhost (for instance alfresco.com), the services will be available in http://alfresco.com or https://alfresco.com
